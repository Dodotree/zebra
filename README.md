Basic tool for exploration what kinds of video/audio streams are available on different devices and browsers.
WebGL2 copies of it for filtering or recording. Will be useful for small projects like:

-- Striped image segmentation
-- Thermal printer shader
-- Camera distortion calibrations
-- Flat paper leaf projection
-- 3D snap from RGB and Depth camera combination
