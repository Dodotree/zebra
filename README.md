- **WebGL Processing**: Apply real-time shaders to video streams
- **Resolution Switching**: Test different resolutions and aspect ratios
- **Depth Camera Support**: Special handling for depth cameras (Intel RealSense)
- **Media Capture**: Take snapshots and save configurations
- **Audio Visualization**: View audio input levels
- **Advanced Controls**: Pan, tilt, zoom and other camera capabilities when available
- **Settings Export**: Download camera configurations as JSON

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open index.html in a compatible browser
3. Grant permission to access cameras/microphones
4. Select a camera or mic from the dropdown
5. Explore available controls and settings

## 📸 Use Cases

Zebra is particularly useful for:

- **Calibrating Camera Settings**: Fine-tune exposure, brightness, and other parameters
- **Shader Development**: Test WebGL2 shaders on live video feeds
- **Depth Sensing**: Work with RGB+D cameras like Intel RealSense
- **Camera Capability Testing**: Discover which features are available on different devices
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify camera behavior across browsers

## 🔧 Technical Details

Zebra is built with modern web technologies:
- WebRTC for camera access
- MediaStream API for device control
- WebGL2 for GPU-accelerated processing
- Custom elements for modular UI components

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- Chrome (desktop & mobile)
- Firefox (desktop & mobile)
- Safari (iOS limitations apply)
- Edge (Chromium-based)
- Mobile Safari on iPhone
- Galaxy

Note: Some features depend on browser implementation of MediaStream capabilities.

## 📊 Example Projects

Zebra enables many creative and technical projects:
- Striped image segmentation
- Thermal printer shader effects
- Camera distortion calibration
